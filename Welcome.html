        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Blythe, a wedding and portrait photographer based in Knoxville, Tennessee. My journey with photography began back in middle school, and over the years, it’s evolved into one of my greatest passions. I recently graduated from Pellissippi State Community College with my A.A.S. in Photography, where I refined my skills and deepened my understanding of the art.

                Photography isn’t just a job for me, it’s a way to connect with people, hear their stories, and capture meaningful moments. Every photo I take is an opportunity to preserve something beautiful and personal, whether it's a joyous celebration or a quiet, intimate moment. Photography has been a love of mine for many years, and as a photographer, I am dedicated to preserving the moments that will resonate for a lifetime.
